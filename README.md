The settings for key rebinding and macros I use with the Kinesis Advantage2 Keyboard

## Entering the virtual flash drive

 1. Enter Power User Mode (PUM): progm + shift + esc.
 2. Open the virtual drive (v-drive): progm + F1


## Closing the v-drive

1. Double check that all edited .txt files are saved
2. Eject the v-drive.
3. Close the v-drive by clicking progm +F1. The LEDs on the Keyboard will flash twice when
the drive is closed.
4. Ignore any messages from the system that complains about the drive not being ejected properly.


## Creating new hotkey layouts
1. Enter the layout mode you want to start from (DVORAK or QWERTY)
2. Ensure PUM is enabled and v-drive is closed.
3. Click progm + F2 to enter  Hotkey Laout Creation Mode. The Num Lock key will flash rapidly.
4. Enter the key you will use for the Hotkey layout (alphanumeric). After tapping the key the LED will stop flashing.
5. You now have a copy of the layout you were in. (progm + shift + F9 to soft reset to basic DVORAK or QWERTY)


### Activate the hotkey layouts
To activate the layouts you do not need to be in PUM. Press progm + <chosen key> to activate the layout.

## My layouts
- Dvorak layout for mac with Norwegian Keyboard layout. (progm + a)
